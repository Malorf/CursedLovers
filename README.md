# CursedLovers

Thanks for reading this, you can check my portfolio right here :

CursedLovers is available on itch.io : https://malorf.itch.io/cursed-lovers

You will need a steam account. Launch it then you can open the Cursed Lovers' application. Need to be at least 4 players. 

## $I.Synopsis$

This game is a *cooperative multiplayer third person shooter*. From 4 to 10 players, everyone of you will be **connected** to another player from a different color as **LOVERS** !

What's the goal of the game ? To be the last couple on the battlefield ; kick the others !

**WATCHOUT** ! You can only touch players from the **SAME** color than you... *But you can get hidden behind a player from a different color without worries ;)*
